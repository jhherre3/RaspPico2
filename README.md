## üß† How It Works

The Pico 2 is powered by the **RP2350A0A2** microcontroller, a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor designed by Raspberry Pi. You flash your code to the board over USB using a drag-and-drop `.uf2` file or via a debugger if using C/C++. The **BOOTSEL** button puts the board into USB bootloader mode for easy programming.

It supports both **bare-metal development** and **high-level scripting**, making it ideal for beginner and advanced users alike.

## üß∞ Programming Options

- **MicroPython** ‚Äì Easy scripting and fast prototyping.
- **CircuitPython** ‚Äì Adafruit‚Äôs flavor with additional support libraries.
- **C/C++ SDK** ‚Äì Official low-level support for performance applications.
- **Arduino IDE** ‚Äì Beginner-friendly with many libraries (via board manager).

## üß™ Example Use Cases

- GPIO logic and control  
- Sensor interfacing (I2C, SPI, UART)  
- Real-time data acquisition  
- ADC-based voltage monitoring  
- PWM motor or LED control  
- Logic analyzers or timing tools  

---

## üì¶ Getting Started

1. **Download MicroPython or CircuitPython firmware**  
   https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico.html

2. **Flash the board**  
   - Hold down **BOOTSEL** button
   - Plug in USB-C to your PC
   - Drop the `.uf2` file onto the new USB drive named `RPI-RP2`

3. **Start coding**
   - Use Thonny IDE (for MicroPython)
   - Use Arduino IDE with RP2040 board support
   - Use VSCode with the Pico C SDK for full C/C++ development
